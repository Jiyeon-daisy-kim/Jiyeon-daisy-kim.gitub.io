				<p>Jiyeon, who earned a bachelor’s degree in Film & Digital Media from Dongguk University (Seoul, South Korea) and is currently working on the MFA degree in Film and Media art at Emerson College, delivers her message using various media.<br></p>
				<p>Currently working as a <strong>filmmaker</strong>. Jiyeon’s work is driven by insatiable curiosity about society and people’s stories told through the lens of a camera. She previously worked as a videographer at the SBS Digital News Lab and spent several years working as a freelance video editor and motion graphic designer. Jiyeon’s recent works, such as “Suddenly, Home” and “Il y a une mouche,” exemplify her commitment to experimental and boundary-pushing cinema.<br></p>
